# docker.mariadb.rpi.dev
mariadb dev image for rpi (alpine)

This is a developer image for a mariadb instance that can run on a raspberry pi.

It is based on alpine, has default passwords, enabled logs and all the other bad things that make development and debugging easy.

This is a personal toy, do not use this for anything unless you are willing to make it work for you.
